- Install MetaMask Chrome Extension
  - make sure you write down the Mnemonic

- Fund your account created by MetaMask
  - you will need ETH to deploy smart contracts 
    to the Rinkeby Test Network
  - Go to faucet.rinkeby.io to fund the
    account you got from installing MetaMask
    - only the Twitter method works for me

- Deploy the contracts
  - npm run deploy

  of the deployed contracts
